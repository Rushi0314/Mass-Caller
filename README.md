# Mass-Caller

**Mass-Caller** is a hardware/software project designed to automate mass calling tasks. It includes schematic design, PCB/Gerber files, and accompanying documentation for building an automated calling system.

---

## üßê Project Overview

* The project aims to create a device (or system) that can send out automated or scheduled calls/messages in bulk.
* It includes both electronic hardware design (schematics, layout, Gerber files) and supporting documents.
* Useful for applications such as automated notifications, reminder calls, public announcements, or tele-marketing (where compliant with regulations).

## üîß Contents

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs included in the repository:

| File / Folder                                           | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Schematic`                                             | Diagram showing the circuit design of the system.                      |
| `Gerber file`                                           | PCB layout files required for manufacturing the printed circuit board. |
| `AUTOMATED_CALLER_0.DBK`, `AUTOMATED_MASS_CALLER_0.DBK` | Likely design files, drill/board definition, or related CAD/raw files. |
| `.png` files (e.g. `AUTOMATED_MASS_CALLER.png`)         | Visual representation of the layout or device.                         |
| `Automated_Caller.pdf`                                  | Documentation/manual or overview of how to assemble/use the system.    |
| `downrev.log`                                           | Change log / version history.                                          |

## ‚úÖ Key Features (assumed / possible)

* Fully open-source hardware: all design files are provided (schematic + Gerber), so you can reproduce the PCB.
* Visual documentation to help with assembly and layout.
* Works ‚Äúmass-scale‚Äù (bulk operations), so good for automation.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats / To-Do

* The README currently lacks detailed instructions. (There‚Äôs ‚Äúno description, website, or topics provided.‚Äù) ([GitHub][1])
* It‚Äôs not clear from the existing files exactly what the software side is, or how to program/control the hardware.
* Need clarifications on power requirements, interfacing (which microcontroller, communication protocols), legal/compliance aspects (for mass calls).

## üîÑ Getting Started (suggested)

1. Review the schematic and Gerber files to understand the PCB design.
2. Order manufacturing of the PCB based on the Gerber files.
3. Gather required components as per the schematic.
4. Assemble the hardware.
5. Refer to the PDF documentation for operational instructions (if available).
6. If there is software / firmware needed, get or develop/control software for dialing, scheduling, etc.

## ü§ù Licensing & Contribution

* **License**: (You can insert your chosen open-source license here, e.g. MIT, GPL, etc.)
* **Contributions** welcome: whether for improving documentation, adding software/firmware, enhancing hardware configuration, or polishing user instructions.
